// Welcome to Cypress!
//
// This spec file contains a variety of sample tests
// for a todo list app that are designed to demonstrate
// the power of writing tests in Cypress.
//
// To learn more about how Cypress works and
// what makes it such an awesome testing tool,
// please read our getting started guide:
// https://on.cypress.io/introduction-to-cypress

    // Cypress starts out with a blank slate for each test
    // so we must tell it to visit our website with the `cy.visit()` command.
    // Since we want to visit the same URL at the start of all our tests,
    // we include it in our beforeEach function so that it runs before each test
    cy.visit(
      // this url targets storybook story directly, instead of through the storybook ui
      "http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?id=welcome--default&args=&viewMode=story"

    // Then, we use `should` to assert that there are two matched items,
    // which are the two default items.
